# Warehouse domain
Applied Artifficial Intelligence Master at UC3M planification project developed by Chen Mu Wang Lin and Simón Bermejo Méndez. It consists on a warehouse domain, where an autonomous agent must plan resources (battery and time) to get some packages from warehouses and process them at a process room, minimizing the total time spent. 

Folder `problems` contains different problems definition that enforces agent to chose different paths in order to test the correct deffinition of the domain, while `plans` folder contains the result to those problems obtained with `cbp-roller` planner.
